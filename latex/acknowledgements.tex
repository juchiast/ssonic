\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank professor Nguyen Dinh Thuc, for his guidance on my cryptographic studies, and his advice and feedback on the dissertation. I was unsure about which topic I wanted to do for my graduate thesis, professor Thuc introduced me to various interesting topics in cryptography, which is the reason why this thesis is possible. I also want to thank Nguyen Van Quang Huy and Ngo Dinh Hy, former students of professor Thuc, who provided feedback, guidance, and materials for this work. I also want to thank my friend Mai Nguyen Anh Vu, who referred me to professor Thuc.

I would like to thank the University of Science and the faculty of Information Technology, for providing the environment in which this thesis took place. 

Finally, I want to thank my family for providing supports, and thank God for giving me the wisdom with which I study and finish this thesis.
